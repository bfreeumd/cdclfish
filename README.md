# cdclfish
Mostly arduino code and libraries for the CDCL reaction wheel fish.

This is on the imuTest branch.

If the other ino file is in the same directory as the one you want to include it in, there is nothing you need to do. The IDE combines all ino files into one cpp file for compiling. Splitting IMU code into many separate pieces to make it easier to integrate into the MASTER FILE.
